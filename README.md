# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Wireless-Communication


In the era to come, wireless communication system envisaged to deal with an extreme diversity for internet of thingsand to contemplate its challenging 
requirements, sixth-generation (6G) promises to support the wireless networksystems with enhanced data rate, reduced latency, maximized capacity, 
adaptability and reliability. Similarly, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) along with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) has the significant 
potentialto meet the demands of future wireless communication networks. That is why, it is inevitable to empower future 6Gwireless network with Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), a driving force to wireless networks and a state-of-the-art machinelearning technique, discussed in the paper that employs a deep neural 
network (DNN) for the data recovery with and without imperfections in MIMO-NOMA.
